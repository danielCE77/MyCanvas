# MyCanvas
### MyCanvas

This is the first practice where we use different tools to paint a blue sky and a sun inside a window, the tools we use are in java.awt and javax.swing
which are: 

*java.awt.Color*
*java.awt.Dimension*
*java.awt.Graphics*
*javax.swing.JPanel*

> note: I make the sun a little bigger :smile:
